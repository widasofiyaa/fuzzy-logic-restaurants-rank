Recent technological developments are increasingly evenly distributed in various aspects, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is classified as intelligence created by machines. Artificial intelligence is generated and programmed into a system (computer) to perform tasks that humans can perform. The principle of partial truth was introduced in fuzzy logic, which enhances boolean logic. The truth level replaces the boolean truth in fuzzy logic. Because the modern and methodical science of fuzzy logic was only discovered a few years ago, fuzzy logic is said to be an old new logic, even though in reality the idea of ​​fuzzy logic has been around for a long time.  The purpose of writing this report is to understand Fuzzy Logic and its application, understand the linguistic name of Fuzzy Logic, understand the membership function of Fuzzy Logic, understand the stages in Fuzzy Logic.  Given a sample of data in the form of excel then asked to determine the 10 best restaurants based on service value and food value. Service value has universe [0-100] and food value has universe [0-10]. Determination of the best 10 is done using the fuzzy logic method.
